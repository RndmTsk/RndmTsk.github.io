    <h1>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h1>
    <p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>
    <p>At no time does the application ask for personally identifyable information. All information added to the app is contained solely on the device.</p>

    <h1>What personal information we collect</h1>
    <p>When you create a nickname for a unit, the nickname, unit, and vehicle type are stored locally on your device and are not shrared outside of the application's secure sandbox. To remove the information, either delete the nickname or the entire app as necessary.</p>

    <h1>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h1>
    <p>When you create a nickname for a unit, the nickname, unit, and vehicle type are stored locally on your device and are not shrared outside of the application's secure sandbox. To remove the information, either delete the nickname or the entire app as necessary.</p>

    <h1>Disclosure to Third Parties</h1>
    <p>Items being tracked are never shared outside of the application's secure sandbox</p>

    <h1>Others</h1>
    <p>It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for Apple to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>

    <h1>Protection of Personal Information</h1>
    <p>The security of your personal information is a very serious matter. To that end, the application has been structured to eliminate the sharing of personal information outside of the secure sandbox.</p>
