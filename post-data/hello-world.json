It's my hope that you enjoy reading my articles as much as I enjoy writing them.<br /><br />This site is dedicated to Swift examples &mdash; including iOS, WatchOS, server, and more! Hint: this site is generated with Swift, you can see the source on my GitHub page! It uses Swift Codable, Generics, Stencil, and more. Using .json files inside data directories, it generates .html pages using various templates &mdash; no database required.<br /><br />It is my hope that along with all the other blogs out there, I can shed some light on my experiences with Swift and hopefully help you on your journey as well. I have a lot to share, hopefully you're willing to listen!","title":"Hello World","formattedDate":"Feb 20, 2019","date":573395844.74211705,"link":"\/posts\/hello-world.html","tags":["blog"],"callout":"this site has been a while in the making"}
